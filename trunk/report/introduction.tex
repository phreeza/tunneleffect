%Motivation(BCS predicts Gap)
The theory of superconductivity presented by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in 1957 predicts a gap in the allowed energies for electrons. Even though this gap had been measured indirectly by several methods, it had not been measured directly until 1960, when Giaver conducted his electron tunneling experiment. Here we report our attempt to reproduce this seminal work.\\
In 1973 Giaver was awarded the Nobel Prize for his achievement. This is a feat we are not attempting to reproduce here; a 10 would be sufficient\dots
