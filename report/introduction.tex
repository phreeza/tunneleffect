%Motivation(BCS predicts Gap)
The theory of superconductivity presented by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in 1957 predicts a gap in the allowed energies for electrons. Even though this gap had been measured indirectly by several methods, it had not been measured directly until Giaver conducted his electron tunneling experiment, which we have attempted to reproduce here.
